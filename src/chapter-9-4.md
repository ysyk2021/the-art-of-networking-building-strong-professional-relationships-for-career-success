This may involve using a customer relationship management (CRM) tool, creating lists or tags within your email or social media platforms, or simply keeping a spreadsheet of your contacts.

Curating Your Network

Engaging with your connections strategically can help you avoid information overload and ensure that you are making the most of your networking efforts. This may involve setting aside specific times to check your social media or email, responding promptly to messages from important connections, and prioritizing your outreach efforts based on your professional goals.

Using Data Analytics to Monitor Progress

Data analytics can be a powerful tool for monitoring your networking progress and identifying areas for improvement. By tracking metrics like the number of new connections made, engagement with your content, and response rates to your outreach efforts, you can adjust your networking strategy as needed and ensure that you are making the most of your technology tools.
